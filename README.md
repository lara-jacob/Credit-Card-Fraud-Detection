# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project employs machine learning algorithms to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time. As online transactions become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their security is critical. This project aims to enhance fraud detection systems by analyzing transaction data and detecting anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity.

## Project Objectives
* Real-Time Detection: Implement a machine learning model to identify fraudulent transactions as they occur.
* Data Analysis: Use historical transaction data to train and evaluate the model.
* Anomaly Detection: Detect unusual patterns and behaviors in transactions to flag potential fraud.

## Features

* Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Aggregated a diverse dataset with features such as transaction amount, location, time, and transaction type.
Handled missing values, normalized numerical features, and encoded categorical variables for effective model training.

* Model Selection and Training:
Evaluated various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Implemented cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness and avoid overfitting.

* Evaluation Metrics:
Assessed model performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
Used confusion matrices to analyze the classification performance and improve detection accuracy.

* Deployment:
Created a prototype for real-time fraud detection that can be integrated into transaction processing systems.
